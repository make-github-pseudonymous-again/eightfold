### *Five.* Dropbox
> In July 2018, researchers at Northwestern University published an article

> platform across 1000 universities. Personal names attached to the data
> was removed by Dropbox, but according to Casey Fiesler, researcher at
> Colorado University, the folder titles and file structures that were provided
> could be used to identify individuals. Dropbox, later in a blog post,
> said that the reverse identification of the data was impossible. The data was
> provided without the express consent of the 16 thousand people whose
> information was accessed.
